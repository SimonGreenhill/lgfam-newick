This repository contains the data and code associated with the **PAPER**.
The code is released under GPL v2, but the various pieces of input data might be govered by different licenses (specified in the respective folders).

The aims of this project are to:

a) provide several well-known linguistic (genealogical) classifications (currently [WALS](http://wals.info/), [Ethnologue](http://www.ethnologue.com/), [Glottolog](http://glottolog.org/) and [AUTOTYP](http://www.autotyp.uzh.ch/)) in the *de facto* standard [Newick format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format), and
b) offer a set of [`R`](http://www.r-project.org/) `S3` classes and functions for reading, converting, writing and working with language family trees.

The accompanying **PAPER** describes in detail the data sources and conversion process.

This repository contains:

a) the original data and code associated with the **PAPER**, but also
b) updates and bugfixes concerning the data and code.

If you find this useful please cite the **PAPER** in your work!
